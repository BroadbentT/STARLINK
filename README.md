## COMMAND CENTRE FOR REMOTE SATELLITE ANALYSIS

STARLINK is a lightweight, portable Python-based satellite cybersecurity research project designed to support the analysis, validation and security assessment of spacecraft communication protocols, satellite ground infrastructure and simulated space systems.

Inspired by modern satellite exploitation training and the security challenges surrounding Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) systems, STARLINK aims to bring essential satellite-security research capabilities into a unified command-line environment.

The project roadmap covers CCSDS protocol analysis, telemetry inspection, telecommand frame construction, RF signal analysis, orbital visibility calculations, ground-station security testing and embedded spacecraft systems research.

**Platform:** Kali Linux 2026
**Language:** Python 3
**Interface:** Command-line interface (CLI)
**Release:** Beta
**Target environment:** Authorised assessments, laboratory simulations, CTFs and isolated test systems.

## LEGAL & ETHICAL USE

### COMPUTER MISUSE ACT 1990 — SECTION 3A

STARLINK is intended for legitimate cybersecurity research, authorised penetration testing, protocol validation, educational laboratories and controlled simulations.

Users are responsible for obtaining appropriate permission before testing any satellite system, ground station, communication link or associated infrastructure. Do not transmit commands to spacecraft or operational satellite infrastructure without explicit authorisation.

Unauthorised interference with satellite communications or space infrastructure may create safety, operational and legal consequences.

The developer does not endorse unauthorised access, disruption, interference or misuse of this software.
